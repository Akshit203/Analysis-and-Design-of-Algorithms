# Analysis-and-Design-of-Algorithms


## Divide and Conquer

### Binary Search

- **Description**: An efficient algorithm to find an element in a sorted array.

### Merge Sort

- **Description**: A sorting algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts each half separately, and then merges them.

### Quick Sort

- **Description**: A sorting algorithm that picks an element as pivot and partitions the array around the pivot.

### Selection Problem

- **Description**: Finding the kth smallest/largest element in an unsorted array.

### Matrix Multiplication

- **Description**: Multiplying two matrices using divide and conquer approach.

### Stassenâ€™s Method

- **Description**: An algorithm for matrix multiplication that is more efficient than the traditional approach for large matrices.

## Greedy Method

### Knapsack Problem

- **Description**: A problem where items have certain values and weights, and the goal is to determine the combination of items to include in a knapsack so as to maximize the total value without exceeding its weight capacity.

### Job Sequencing with Deadlines

- **Description**: Given a set of jobs with deadlines and profits, the objective is to maximize the total profit by scheduling jobs within their deadlines.

### Minimum Spanning Trees

- **Description**: Find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph, where the total edge weight is minimized while spanning all vertices.

## Dynamic Programming

### Optimal Binary Search Trees

- **Description**: Construct a binary search tree with minimum expected search cost for a given set of keys and their probabilities.

### 0/1 Knapsack

- **Description**: Similar to the knapsack problem, but items can only be selected in their entirety (either 0 or 1 of each item).

### Travelling Salesperson Problem

- **Description**: Find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city.

## Backtracking

### 8 Queens Problem

- **Description**: Place eight queens on an 8x8 chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

### Graph Coloring

- **Description**: Assign colors to vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, using the minimum number of colors.

### Hamiltonian Cycles

- **Description**: Find a cycle that visits every vertex in a graph exactly once.
